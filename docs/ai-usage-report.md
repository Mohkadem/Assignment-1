- I used ChatGPT to know what to include in .gitignore file.
- I asked ChatGPT this question "what can I do if I have js file contains constants and I want to use it in another js file ? " The thing I was missing is the export keyword before declaring the array statistics. I face this error "Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module (at script.js:23:1)", I asked ChatGPT about it. It explained to me what I should do and why, to make the story short, it said add type attribute and set it to module for the main js file. Also it didn't work, it asked me again to use live server and I downloaded npx live-server but still the same error "script.js:23  GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/js/constants net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)". Finally the problem was because I didn't write the extension .js in the import statement in the main.js. What I learned is that indeed I need to use module as a type attribute int the script link in the html file, however I don't need npx live-server.
